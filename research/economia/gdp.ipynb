    "Yes, the components or parts of the economy are computed in the Gross Domestic Product (GDP). GDP is a measure of the total value of goods and services produced within a country in a specific time period. It can be computed using different approaches, and each approach considers various components:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Expenditure Approach**: This is the most commonly used method. It calculates GDP by summing the total expenditures on all final goods and services produced in the economy. The key components are:\n",
    "   - **Consumption (C)**: Spending by households on goods and services.\n",
    "   - **Investment (I)**: Spending on capital goods like machinery, equipment, and construction, as well as inventory changes.\n",
    "   - **Government Spending (G)**: Expenditures by the government on goods and services.\n",
    "   - **Net Exports (NX)**: Exports minus imports. It shows the value of goods and services exported to other countries minus the value of imports.\n",
    "\n",
    "   \n",
    "   Formula:  \n",
    "   GDP = C + I + G + (X - M)  \n",
    "   where X is exports and M is imports.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Income Approach**: This approach calculates GDP by summing all the incomes earned in the production of goods and services. The key components include:\n",
    "   - Wages and salaries.\n",
    "   - Rents.\n",
    "   - Interest.\n",
    "   - Profits.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Production (or Output) Approach**: This sums the value added at each stage of production, subtracting the value of intermediate goods to avoid double-counting. It focuses on the production side of the economy.\n",
    "\n",
    "Each of these components contributes to the overall GDP calculation, ensuring a comprehensive measure of economic activity."
