### 1. **Collect Data on Trade and Production**
   - **Trade Data**: Gather data on the export and import of products by different countries. This can come from sources like the UN Comtrade database or the Observatory of Economic Complexity (OEC).
   - **Production Data**: Collect data on the production of goods within countries, if available. This helps in understanding what countries can produce beyond what they export.

### 2. **Identify Products**
   - **Product Classification**: Use a standardized classification system, such as the Harmonized System (HS) codes or Standard International Trade Classification (SITC), to categorize products.
   - **Predefine Product Positions (Optional)**: You could start by positioning products in a space based on their characteristics (e.g., complexity, similarity, or factor intensity). This helps in organizing them initially but isn’t strictly necessary as the connections will naturally define the space.

### 3. **Calculate Relatedness Between Products**
   - **Co-Export Probability**: Calculate the likelihood that two products are exported by the same country. High co-export probability suggests relatedness in terms of the capabilities needed for production.
   - **Revealed Comparative Advantage (RCA)**: Use RCA to assess whether a country is specialized in a product. Products with similar RCA profiles in various countries are likely related.

### 4. **Build the Product Space Network**
   - **Node Creation**: Each product is represented as a node in the network.
   - **Edge Formation**: Create connections (edges) between nodes based on their relatedness. Stronger connections indicate that the production capabilities for one product are similar to those for another.

### 5. **Visualize the Product Space**
   - **Network Visualization**: Use tools like Gephi, Cytoscape, or custom visualization software to map the product space. Products are positioned based on their connections; densely connected nodes (products) form clusters.
   - **Positioning**: While predefined positions can help in initial setup, the network's topology will naturally adjust based on the connections. Products related through shared capabilities will cluster together.

### 6. **Analyze the Product Space**
   - **Clusters**: Identify clusters of related products to understand groups of products that require similar capabilities.
   - **Pathways for Economic Development**: Analyze the proximity of products within the space to identify potential opportunities for countries to diversify their production by moving to nearby products in the space.

### 7. **Country-Specific Mapping**
   - **Overlay Country Data**: Map specific countries onto the product space by highlighting the products they currently produce or export.
   - **Development Strategies**: Use the map to suggest diversification strategies for countries by identifying products close to their current capabilities.

### 8. **Iterate and Refine**
   - As more data becomes available or as the understanding of the connections between products evolves, refine the product space model.

### Predefined Positions vs. Dynamic Connections
- **Predefined Positions**: This approach can give an initial structure, especially if based on economic theory or product characteristics. However, it might constrain the natural clustering that arises from empirical data.
- **Dynamic Connections**: Building the space dynamically based on data-driven connections allows for a more flexible and potentially more accurate representation of the product space.

In conclusion, while predefined positions can be useful, the strength and nature of connections between products, based on co-production and related capabilities, will ultimately define the product space. The goal is to create a map that reflects the actual economic and production relationships between products, guiding countries in their economic diversification strategies.
